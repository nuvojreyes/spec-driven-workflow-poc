# Frontend (Angular)

Minimal Angular scaffold.

Setup:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# If you don't have Angular CLI installed globally, use:
# npx @angular/cli@16 serve
npm start
```

Then open: http://localhost:4200

Notes:

- This is a minimal scaffold; run `npm install` to fetch Angular packages.
- The backend API lives in `../backend` at `/api/`.
